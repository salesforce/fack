# Recently Viewed Items - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes all files created and modified to implement the "Recently Viewed Items" feature.

## Files Created

### 1. Migration File
**File**: `db/migrate/20251017181945_create_viewed_items.rb`

Creates the `viewed_items` table with polymorphic associations and strategic indexes.

**Key Features**:
- Polymorphic `viewable` reference
- User reference with foreign key
- `viewed_at` timestamp
- Three composite indexes for performance
- Unique constraint to prevent duplicates

### 2. ViewedItem Model
**File**: `app/models/viewed_item.rb`

Active Record model for the viewed_items table.

**Key Features**:
- Polymorphic association to viewable items
- Belongs to user
- Validations for all required fields
- Uniqueness validation at model level
- Scopes for common queries (`recent`, `for_type`)

### 3. Documentation Files
- `docs/recently-viewed-items-feature.md` - Comprehensive feature documentation
- `docs/recently-viewed-implementation-summary.md` - This file

## Files Modified

### 1. User Model
**File**: `app/models/user.rb`

**Changes Added**:
```ruby
# Association
has_many :viewed_items, dependent: :destroy

# Helper Methods
def recently_viewed_documents(limit: 5)
  # Returns Document objects ordered by most recent view
end

def recently_viewed(viewable_type:, limit: 5)
  # Generic method for any viewable type
end
```

**Line Numbers**: Added after line 18 (after comments association)

### 2. Document Model
**File**: `app/models/document.rb`

**Changes Added**:
```ruby
# Recently viewed items feature
has_many :viewed_items, as: :viewable, dependent: :destroy
```

**Line Numbers**: Added after line 10 (after `has_neighbors :embedding`)

### 3. DocumentsController
**File**: `app/controllers/documents_controller.rb`

**Changes Added**:

In the `show` action (after line 17):
```ruby
# Track view for authenticated users
track_document_view if current_user
```

New private method (at end of file):
```ruby
private

def track_document_view
  viewed_item = ViewedItem.find_or_initialize_by(
    user: current_user,
    viewable: @document
  )
  viewed_item.viewed_at = Time.current
  viewed_item.save
end
```

## Database Changes

### New Table: `viewed_items`

**Columns**:
- `id` (bigint, primary key)
- `user_id` (bigint, not null)
- `viewable_type` (string, not null)
- `viewable_id` (bigint, not null)
- `viewed_at` (datetime)
- `created_at` (datetime)
- `updated_at` (datetime)

**Indexes**:
1. `index_viewed_items_on_user_id` (auto-created with references)
2. `index_viewed_items_on_viewable` (auto-created with polymorphic references)
3. `index_viewed_items_on_user_id_and_viewed_at` (composite, for user queries)
4. `index_viewed_items_on_viewable_type_and_viewable_id_and_viewed_at` (composite, for item queries)
5. `index_viewed_items_on_user_and_viewable` (composite, unique constraint)

**Foreign Keys**:
- `user_id` references `users.id`

## How to Use

### In Controllers

Views are automatically tracked in `DocumentsController#show` for logged-in users.

### In Views

Display recently viewed documents:

```erb
<% current_user.recently_viewed_documents(limit: 5).each do |doc| %>
  <%= link_to doc.title, document_path(doc) %>
<% end %>
```

### In Console

```ruby
# Get recently viewed documents for a user
user = User.find(1)
user.recently_viewed_documents(limit: 10)

# Track a view manually
ViewedItem.create(
  user: user,
  viewable: Document.find(1),
  viewed_at: Time.current
)

# Get viewing stats
document = Document.find(1)
document.viewed_items.count # Total views
document.viewed_items.distinct.count(:user_id) # Unique viewers
```

## Testing the Implementation

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Start the Rails server**:
   ```bash
   bin/rails server
   ```

2. **Log in as a user**

3. **Visit several document pages**:
   - Each visit should create or update a ViewedItem record

4. **Check the database**:
   ```ruby
   # Rails console
   user = User.first
   user.viewed_items.count
   user.recently_viewed_documents
   ```

5. **Verify timestamp updates**:
   - Visit the same document twice
   - Check that the `viewed_at` timestamp updates

### Database Verification

```sql
-- Check the table structure
\d viewed_items

-- View all indexes
\di viewed_items*

-- Check recent views
SELECT * FROM viewed_items ORDER BY viewed_at DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Count unique viewers per document
SELECT viewable_id, COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as unique_viewers
FROM viewed_items
WHERE viewable_type = 'Document'
GROUP BY viewable_id
ORDER BY unique_viewers DESC;
```

## Migration Status

The migration has been successfully run:

```
== 20251017181945 CreateViewedItems: migrated (0.0287s) =======================
```

All database changes are now applied to the development database.

## Next Steps

### Recommended Enhancements

1. **Add to Dashboard**: Display recently viewed documents on user dashboard
2. **Add Caching**: Cache recent documents list in Redis for performance
3. **Add Analytics**: Create admin views to see popular documents
4. **Add Cleanup Task**: Create rake task to archive old view records
5. **Add Tests**: Write comprehensive RSpec tests (examples in documentation)
6. **Extend to Other Models**: Add viewing tracking for other content types

### Optional Features

1. **View Duration Tracking**: Track how long users spend on each document
2. **Privacy Controls**: Add user preference to opt-out of tracking
3. **Trending Documents**: Calculate trending documents based on recent views
4. **Recommendations**: Use viewing history for content recommendations
5. **View Count Display**: Show view counts on document pages

## Rollback Instructions

If you need to rollback this feature:

```bash
# Rollback the migration
bin/rails db:rollback

# Remove the model file
rm app/models/viewed_item.rb

# Revert changes to User model
# (Remove the viewed_items association and helper methods)

# Revert changes to Document model
# (Remove the viewed_items association)

# Revert changes to DocumentsController
# (Remove the track_document_view call and method)
```
