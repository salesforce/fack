# Recently Viewed Libraries - Extension Summary

## Overview

Extended the "Recently Viewed Items" feature to also track Library views, leveraging the polymorphic design already in place.

## Changes Made

### 1. Library Model (`app/models/library.rb`)

Added polymorphic association:

```ruby
# Recently viewed items feature
has_many :viewed_items, as: :viewable, dependent: :destroy
```

**Lines Added**: After line 11 (after `has_many :users, through: :library_users`)

---

### 2. LibrariesController (`app/controllers/libraries_controller.rb`)

#### Updated `show` action:
```ruby
def show
  # Track view for authenticated users
  track_library_view if current_user
end
```

#### Added private method:
```ruby
private

# Tracks a library view for the current user
# Updates the timestamp if the user has already viewed this library
def track_library_view
  viewed_item = ViewedItem.find_or_initialize_by(
    user: current_user,
    viewable: @library
  )
  viewed_item.viewed_at = Time.current
  viewed_item.save
end
```

---

### 3. User Model (`app/models/user.rb`)

Added new helper method:

```ruby
# Returns the most recently viewed libraries for this user
# @param limit [Integer] the maximum number of libraries to return (default: 5)
# @return [ActiveRecord::Relation<Library>] the recently viewed libraries, ordered by most recent first
def recently_viewed_libraries(limit: 5)
  Library.joins(:viewed_items)
         .where(viewed_items: { user_id: id })
         .order('viewed_items.viewed_at DESC')
         .distinct
         .limit(limit)
end
```

**Lines Added**: After the `recently_viewed_documents` method (line 33-43)

---

### 4. DashboardController (`app/controllers/dashboard_controller.rb`)

Added library view tracking to the index action:

```ruby
@recently_viewed_libraries = current_user.recently_viewed_libraries(limit: 5)
                                         .includes(:viewed_items)
```

**Line Added**: Line 16-17

---

### 5. Dashboard View (`app/views/dashboard/index.html.erb`)

#### Updated grid layout:
Changed from:
```erb
<div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-6">
```

To:
```erb
<div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 xl:grid-cols-5 gap-6">
```

This provides responsive layout:
- **Mobile (default)**: 1 column
- **Medium screens (md)**: 2 columns
- **Large screens (lg)**: 3 columns
- **Extra large screens (xl)**: 5 columns

#### Added new card section:
```erb
<!-- Recently Viewed Libraries -->
<div class="bg-white rounded-lg p-6 border border-gray-300">
  <div class="flex justify-between items-center mb-4">
    <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-700 flex items-center">
      <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="h-5 w-5 mr-2" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor">

      </svg>
    <% end %>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <% if @recently_viewed_libraries.any? %>
      <% @recently_viewed_libraries.each do |library| %>
        <% viewed_item = library.viewed_items.find_by(user: current_user) %>
        <%= render "dashboard/list_item",
          path: library_path(library),
          title: library.name.truncate(50),
          subtitle: "Viewed #{time_ago_in_words(viewed_item.viewed_at)} ago" %>
      <% end %>
    <% else %>
      <p class="text-gray-400 italic">No recently viewed libraries</p>
    <% end %>
  </div>
</div>
```

Also changed the "Recently Viewed" title for documents to "Docs Viewed" for consistency.

## Dashboard Layout

The dashboard now displays **5 activity cards**:

1. **Questions** - Recent questions asked by the user
2. **Chats** - Recent chat sessions
3. **Assistants** - Recently used assistants
4. **Docs Viewed** - Recently viewed documents ✨ (NEW)
5. **Libraries Viewed** - Recently viewed libraries ✨ (NEW)

---

## How It Works

### Automatic Tracking

When a user views a library page:
1. The `LibrariesController#show` action is triggered
2. If the user is authenticated, `track_library_view` is called
3. A `ViewedItem` record is created or updated with the current timestamp
4. The user's recently viewed libraries list is automatically updated

### Viewing History

Users can see their recently viewed libraries:

**In Views:**
```erb
<% current_user.recently_viewed_libraries(limit: 5).each do |library| %>
  <%= link_to library.name, library_path(library) %>
<% end %>
```

**In Controllers/Console:**
```ruby
# Get recently viewed libraries
user.recently_viewed_libraries(limit: 10)

# Get all view history
user.viewed_items.where(viewable_type: 'Library')

# Get viewing stats for a library
library = Library.find(1)
library.viewed_items.count # Total views
library.viewed_items.distinct.count(:user_id) # Unique viewers
```

---

## Database Schema (No Changes Required)

The existing polymorphic `viewed_items` table handles both Documents and Libraries:

```ruby
# Example records:
ViewedItem.create(user_id: 1, viewable_type: 'Document', viewable_id: 5, viewed_at: Time.current)
ViewedItem.create(user_id: 1, viewable_type: 'Library', viewable_id: 3, viewed_at: Time.current)
```

The unique index ensures one record per user-viewable combination:
```ruby
add_index :viewed_items, [:user_id, :viewable_type, :viewable_id], 
          unique: true, 
          name: 'index_viewed_items_on_user_and_viewable'
```

---

## Testing

### Manual Testing

1. **Visit a library page** (e.g., `/libraries/1`)
2. **Visit another library page** (e.g., `/libraries/2`)
3. **Go to the dashboard** (`/`)
4. **Verify** the "Libraries Viewed" card shows both libraries ordered by most recent

### Console Testing

```ruby
# Create a test scenario
user = User.first
library = Library.first

# Simulate a view
ViewedItem.create(
  user: user,
  viewable: library,
  viewed_at: Time.current
)

# Check the results
user.recently_viewed_libraries
# => [#<Library id: 1, ...>]

# Check view statistics
library.viewed_items.count
# => 1
```

---

## Performance Considerations

### Query Optimization

The implementation includes:

1. **Eager Loading**: `.includes(:viewed_items)` prevents N+1 queries
2. **Database Indexes**: Existing composite indexes optimize lookups
3. **Distinct Results**: Ensures no duplicate libraries in the list
4. **Limit Clause**: Restricts result set size

### Query Examples

```ruby
# Efficient query generated by recently_viewed_libraries
SELECT DISTINCT "libraries".* 
FROM "libraries" 
INNER JOIN "viewed_items" 
  ON "viewed_items"."viewable_id" = "libraries"."id" 
  AND "viewed_items"."viewable_type" = 'Library'
WHERE "viewed_items"."user_id" = 1
ORDER BY "viewed_items"."viewed_at" DESC
LIMIT 5
```

---

## Extension Pattern

To add more viewable models in the future, follow this pattern:

### 1. Add association to the model:
```ruby
has_many :viewed_items, as: :viewable, dependent: :destroy
```

### 2. Track views in the controller:
```ruby
def show
  track_view if current_user
end

private

def track_view
  ViewedItem.find_or_initialize_by(
    user: current_user,
    viewable: @resource
  ).tap do |item|
    item.viewed_at = Time.current
    item.save
  end
end
```

### 3. Add helper method to User model:
```ruby
def recently_viewed_<model_name>(limit: 5)
  ModelName.joins(:viewed_items)
           .where(viewed_items: { user_id: id })
           .order('viewed_items.viewed_at DESC')
           .distinct
           .limit(limit)
end
```
